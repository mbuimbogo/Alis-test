# Alis Build Frontend Challenge

We're excited to see your abilities in action! To give you a chance to showcase your skills, we've prepared a basic frontend application and an API endpoint that retrieves product data from `dummyjson.com/products`.

Your task is to build a user-friendly interface to display this information. The initial focus will be on presenting the first 30 products in an attractive and informative way, with each product entry including key details. Users should be able to click on a product to access more detailed information (the specific details are up to you). Additionally, the interface should allow users to:

- Delete products directly from the list (with confirmation to prevent accidental deletion).
- Search for products by name or other relevant criteria using a search bar.
- Group products by category (data available from the API).

We've provided pre-defined colors and styles to ensure a consistent design throughout the application. The challenge does not require you to host the application on any service provider. We encourage you to go beyond the core functionalities and showcase your expertise in various areas. This includes creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, ensuring smooth navigation and interactions, and writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

The project is set up with Vue 3, Vite and Vuetify as the design framework. We're more interested in your problem-solving skills and the overall quality of the solution than your depth of knowledge of the specific technologies used. Resources for these technologies are provided for your reference. Let's see what you can create!
